                <p>
                    Mauritius, island country in the Indian Ocean, located off the eastern coast of Africa.
                    Physiographically, it is part of the Mascarene Islands. The capital is Port Louis. Mauritius lies
                    about 500 miles (800 km) east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Its outlying territories are
                    Rodrigues Island, situated about 340 miles (550 km) eastward, the Cargados Carajos Shoals, 250 miles
                    (400 km) northeastward, and the Agalega Islands, 580 miles (930 km) northward from the main island.
                    Mauritius also claims sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago (including Diego Garcia), some 1,250
                    miles (2,000 km) to the northeast, although this claim is disputed by Britain.

                <p>
                    The island of Mauritius is volcanic in origin and is almost entirely surrounded by coral reefs. The
                    northern part is a plain that rises to a central plateau, varying in elevation from about 900 to
                    2,400 feet (270 to 730 metres) above sea level. The plateau is bordered by small mountains that may
                    have formed the rim of an ancient volcano; the highest point (2,717 feet [828 metres]) is Piton de
                    la Petite Rivière Noire in the southwest. The two major rivers, the Grand River South East and the
                    Black River, are the primary sources of hydroelectric power. Lake Vacoas, one of the main
                    reservoirs, is the chief source of water.
